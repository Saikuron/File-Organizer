# Files organizer

Program aiming to reorganize a folder efficiently

## To do

- Directory as argument ~7d #feat @Saikuron 2022-09-15
  - Don't make fo act on the current directory by default. Instead force the user to specify the target directory as an argument.
- Prevent fo from moving/deleting itself ~1d #bug @Saikuron 2022-09-15

## In progress

- Add a Makefile ~1d #feat @Saikuron 2022-09-14

## Done

- Remove overlapping files ~1d @Saikuron 2022-09-13
  - When the project was initially made, we worked on 2 separate files and then merged everything, without removing useless code
